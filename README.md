# blindtest-spotify

This is a simple demo of how to create a blindtest using Spotify and React.

## About

I fork this depository from [Clement Escolano](https://github.com/clement-escolano) from the [Theodo](https://www.theodo.fr/) Code Dojo.

The goal there is to discover ReactJS and the Spotify API and use them. 
We use React Component state and props in it.
