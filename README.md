# blindtest-spotify

This is a simple demo of how to create a blindtest using Spotify and React.

## About

I fork this depository from [Clement Escolano](https://github.com/clement-escolano) from the [Theodo](https://www.theodo.fr/) Code Dojo.

The goal there is to discover ReactJS and the Spotify API and use them. 
We use React Component state and props in it.

It's not finished yet.

Actually, we need to modify the token everytime, 
so if you want to test the app get the right token [there](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user-saved-tracks/?market=FR&limit=15&offset=0).
